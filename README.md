# TimePods## IntroBasic intro of what this app is about goes here.## Functional RequirementsAs a user, I want to create a time box so that I can have a list of time boxes I want to complete for the day.As a user, I want to activate a time box by tapping it so that I can keep track of how much time I have committed to that time box activity and be alerted when my time is up for it.As a user, I want to be able to pause a time box by tapping it while active so I can pause it if I am interrupted during my time box activity.As a user, I want positive feedback for when I use Time Boxes consecutive days in a row and for completing all my time boxes and indicating that I have completed them. Avatar at top showing “level” of commitment. (Peasant, squire, knight, duke, KING) etc.As a user, I want the app to ease me into usage of the app to make adopting the app easy so that I can stay committed to using it and improving my life.As a user, I want a short three-page tutorial at the start so that I can learn to use the app right away.As a user, I want a specialized introduction to the app after the tutorial to get me started so that I can stick with the app and improve my life.As a user, I want to be able to easily track my progress of my currently activated time box in the middle of it.As a user, I want to be notified when my active time box has completed so I know when to stop.## MockupsMockups of the app's UI go here.
